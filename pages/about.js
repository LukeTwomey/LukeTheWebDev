          Hello and welcome! My name's Luke Twomey and I'm a web developer
          currently working for ASOS in sunny Camden. Before that I was working
          at Sky.

        <p>
          Iâ€™ve made a career out of coding since 2015, and I also like to work
          on various side projects, [my blog] being just one of them!
