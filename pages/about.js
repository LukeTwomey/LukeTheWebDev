          I have been programming since 2015, and I just love the process of
          bringing something to life through code.

        <p>
          I have always been a very logical person, methodical and well
          organised, with a talent for problem solving and a high attention to
          detail. I had always known I enjoyed development - right from when I
          first started programming in university.

          I currently live in Walthamstow with my fianc√©e Fi and Twiglet the
          cat. Obligatory cat tax below!

          You'll often find me working on personal projects outside of work, the
          latest being the current iteration of this very website. It is written
          in React, and uses Next.js to benefit from server-side rendering.

        <p>
          The main focus of this site is <Link href={"/blog"}>my new blog</Link>
          , which I will be updating each week. I found sites like this
          invaluable to me when I was learning to code, and I would love to
          share my knowledge with you and help you on your web development
          journey, whatever stage you're at.

          emphasize that and how it will help people learn. Believe I am able to
          explain things as clearly as possible. If you dont want to miss any

          but can also put a cta at the end to move them elsewhere in the site.
