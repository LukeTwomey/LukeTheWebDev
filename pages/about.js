          I currently live in London with my fianc√©e Fi and Twiglet the cat -
          obligatory pic below! He loves to play fetch with the ball by his
          tail. He thinks he's a dog.

          You'll often find me working on personal projects outside of work, the
          latest being the current iteration of this website. It is written in
          React, and uses Next.js to benefit from server-side rendering. Among
          other benefits, this means blazing fast page load times!
        </p>

        <p>
          The main focus of this site is <Link href={"/blog"}>my blog</Link>,
          which is updated each week. I found blogs invaluable when I was
          learning to code, and I would love to share my knowledge with you and
          help you along your web development journey.

          I only write content that I would appreciate reading myself. All too
          often I come across confusing, inaccurate or outdated posts, which is
          really frustrating when you're trying to overcome a problem!

        <p>
          Why not <Link href={"/blog"}>see what all the fuss is about</Link>?
        </p>

        <Link href="/blog" className="button">
          View Blog
