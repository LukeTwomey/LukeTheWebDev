I have been a web developer since 2015, and I can honestly say I immensely enjoy what I do. I consider that a very fortunate position to be in, and as such I would absolutely recommend this career to you.

There are amazing benefits, the salary is decent and in the right company, the work/life balance is fantastic.

I was doing a completely different job before this, and I taught myself the skills necessary to become a developer. It’s never too late, and if I can do it you can do it!

Of course, this particular role will suit some more than others, and I cover that in more detail in my [is development right for me] post. But in general, I believe you should give it serious consideration if you're already curious. And that's a safe assumption if you're reading this post!

So, you’re sold. You want to become a developer. What next?

## What do I need to learn?

Here are a few basics you need to have in your arsenal. Don’t just read the blogs and watch the courses, make sure you put it into practice and actually get writing code as soon as possible. This will help you absorb the information and cement it into your brain. Start on some fun projects and when you stumble upon a problem (which as a dev you inevitably will!), find the solution. Work through it, understand it, and that process will really help things to stick. Don’t just copy and paste fixes from stackoverflow without understanding what they do. No one would ever do that now, would they?!

### HTML

Hyper-Text Markup Language is at the core of every page on the web. The very text you’re reading right now is written in HTML. The images you see throughout are added by HTML. Everything you see has been added via HTML (albeit generated in a variety of ways) and this is the first place you need to start on your journey.

### CSS

Cascading Style Sheets are the next logical step, as they allow you to style those HTML elements you’ve placed on the page. Want to make your headlines bright pink and so big you can see them from space? CSS is your friend! You should totally do that, by the way.

### JavaScript

The last of the three amigos. Here’s where things get clever (and a little more complex than the first two to learn). JavaScript is a programming language which will enable you to do things like performing actions when users click on elements, fetching data from API’s to display on your site and is also your gateway to learning a front end framework to help create your site.

### Front-End Framework (React, Angular, Vue etc)

Not strictly an essential, although arguably it would be deemed so in today’s market. A front-end framework lets you build a SPA (Single Page Application) from scratch. You will put to use the JavaScript skills you learnt previously to build a web app that will display in the browser.

### Version Control (Git)

This is a big one when it comes to what you need to know as a web developer. When I started my first job as the only developer at a small design business I had no clue about version control or what it entailed. I was uploading new index.html files and renaming old ones to “index’old.html” all over the place! Such was my fear of irretrievably losing something vitally important and causing my company to go under! Little did I know that Git was the answer to all my problems.

## I Brilliantly Learnt All That, What Next?

That’s a pretty good start for what you need to learn initially. You should be able to start a junior role with this level of knowledge.

That's the other thing as well, don't just assume you need to be a rockstar programmer from day one in the job (like I did)! Junior roles exist for this very reason. You will be employed with the understanding that you are only just starting out, and still have a lot to learn. The right company will support your development, assign you a mentor and work with you to improve your skills.

### Put Together a Portfolio

Remember those projects you’ve been working on while you’ve been learning? Time to put those to good use. Pick some things you’re particularly proud of, or make some things from scratch if you really want to impress. Apps, websites, whatever you like. Make something you believe best shows off your awesome new skills!

### Finding the First Job

As I mentioned above, start out by looking for junior positions. They will have lower expectations of you and will support and develop you as you are just starting out. Ignore the ads that are looking for a junior dev with 10 years experience in building full stack, greenfield enterprise applications supporting millions of users. Everyone thinks they're as crazy as you do.

If you’re struggling to find a job, be prepared to start at a lower salary if possible. At my first job I agreed with my ex-boss that I would start on a slightly reduced salary for the first few months, increasing to the advertised amount once I’d proven my skills.

This can be a good strategy for your very first dev job, as it allows you to just get a foot in the door! Any jobs you apply for after that you’ll have the benefit of your existing employer to provide references and vouch for your competency.

## Is a Computing Degree Necessary?

Short answer, no it’s not. I do actually have a degree, and I would hope it helped me by looking good on my CV. But, I know of so many developers who do not. And it is definitely not a requirement in order to get a coding job.
