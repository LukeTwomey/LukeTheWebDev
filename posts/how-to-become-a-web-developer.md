# How to Become a Web Developer

Let me put this out there right from the start: I'm no expert.

_But_ I do know you can use the `<span>` tag to do various great things!

Also, `const hey = new Date()` this line gives you great blah and whatever you need to do here too.

Great! You didn't leave in disgust. now let me explain...

```
const testing = await getPosts();
console.log(testing[0]);
```

And now we're going to talk about React fragments.

###### Oh hey

Adjacent jsx elements must be contained within a parent element. If you don't want to create a div to do this, you can contain them within a fragment like so:

```
class CodeBlock extends PureComponent {
  static propTypes = {
    value: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    language: PropTypes.string,
  };

  static defaultProps = {
    language: null,
  };

  render() {
    const { language, value } = this.props;
    return (
      <SyntaxHighlighter language={language} style={coy}>
        {value}
      </SyntaxHighlighter>
      // <SyntaxHighlighter language={language}>{value}</SyntaxHighlighter>
    );
  }
}
```

I don't claim to be some all-seeing development God, dishing out commandments you must religiously follow before you earn your developer wings. But, I do have the benefit of having gone through the whole process myself.

I was in a completely different career when I decided I wanted to make a change. From knowing little more than how to make a basic "hello world" webpage, I was able to teach myself everything I needed to know in order to land that first, satisfying web development job. If I can do it, so can you.

## Is It The Right Job For Me?

It would be remiss of me to blindly go on explaining how to become a web developer, without at least a brief mention of the type of individual this job would typically suit. Chances are, if you're reading this you already have a good idea that development is for you. If on the other hand, you're not quite sure, hopefully this will help you in making your decision. You can also find out exactly what a web developer does on a day to day basis.
